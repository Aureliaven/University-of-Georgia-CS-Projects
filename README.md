# University-of-Georgia-CS-Projects

This is my collection of projects for computer science courses for my undergraduate degree at University of Georgia.

Some projects were collaborative, and the names of the classmates who worked on the projects are included in the README files and folder names.

This is meant as a demonstration of my Java, C, and C++ programming.
